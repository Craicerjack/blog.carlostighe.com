# House Hunting. 

Where do you begin? Buying a TV, you go to a shop, you view a few TV's, you pick what you like and boom. Done. Houses? Not so much.  
I took the day off work yesterday to view 6 houses in Galway County, has to be outside the city bounds for reasons that, no doubt, make sense to the bureaucrats that dreamed them up. The Iron Cage of Liberty. The systems we create to "help" things go smoothly have to be based on simple rules, yet life is anything but simple, and these arbitrary rules end up caging us in somewhat nonsensical divisions. Anyhoo, 6 houses, 1 day. Houses arent TV's, there aint no central location you can go and try them and decide on which take your fancy, so you have to spend time and energy travelling between them, and picking up the kids, and bringing the kids along, because this is a thing that will affect them too. You also have to breath when said kids mope and trudge along with the all too obvious and frequent, I dont care, Im tired and hungry and why do I have to do this? 

6 Houses across Galway City. Up backroads, dirt tracks, long distances away from schools, up hills, and out the wild atlantic way. 6 Houses, imacculate shining examples of the housing market. Photos taken on brilliant blue sunshine bathed days (hello photoshop, we dont get that kind of weather in Galway). It really is amazing the difference between a good photo of a place and a bad photo. Angles, composition, light, you want to teach art students about these, view a realtors catalogue for houses and then go view the houses themselves. The images dont lie, they just tell an idealised story. The differences between 2 dimensional ideal space and 3 dimensional real space can be vast. Similarly, google maps can show you where a road is, but not how a road is. Spiddal, Furbo, Moycullen, and beyond. High hopes, hopes based on the 2deal, tempered by the 3real. 

Some fine houses, some beautiful houses, some old houses, some huge houses, but its not all down to the house. A house is much more than a house. Its a commute time, its isolation or a place with families, its small and central, or large and solitary, its a kitchen, and a bedroom, and storage for all the crap youve accumulated over the decades of your life, its a cycle home on a crappy winters evening, with driving wind and rain, and poor visibility, and roads with no room for cyclists, and drivers who couldnt care less about you, simply because you slow them down from their hugely important journeys. (hmm off track a bit...)
