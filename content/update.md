What Im reading
What Im listening 
What Im watching
What Im thinking about
What else?


Im pushing myself to try and finish 50 books this year, including comics/graphic novels. I just finished Roadside Picnic, a strange and enthralling book about alien invasion. Its a different take on a well worn topic and well worth the read. Ive had The final volume of Fables sitting on my bedside table for a few months so Im trying to finally get around to that. In preparation and because its been so long, Im going back to the penultimate one to catch up again. Given the time between releases of graphic novels its a case that I tend to have to go back to the previous one just to catch up. On top of that, whilst up in Dublin at Slayer, I picked up the first volume of the Expanse series of books, from Chapters, a fantastic bookshop in Dublin. I love the TV show, starting watching it on recommendation from Warren Ellis, and I have to say that the books are equally as entertaining. 

My listening these days tends to be podcasts on the bike, and music in work, dependent on what Im working on. My list of podcasts can vary but football takes precedence. Football Weekly from the Guardian is always no 1 and The Game from the Times has recently overtaken the Totally Football Show. I just find myself fast forwarding quite a bit of Totally to be fully enjoyable. My growing cycling fanaticism is finding an outlet in a pod called "The War on Cars". Its a pod about reducing car use in cities. Its only after you start cycling regularly that you realise how dangerous and crap the current system is. The bike to worl scheme was a fantastic start but it needs to be built on.
